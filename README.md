### Install

You can copy the files directly from this repo OR (recommended) you can install this project as a node module using npm. Using NPM is ideal for easy updates. It also *will not* give you the enitre project. Doing an install gives you the JavaScript, Less, SCSS, and CSS assets for Mk-Ui only. So don't worry about the install being bulky, it ain't.

```bash
npm install mk-ui
```

### Documentation

Clone or Fork this repository for the most up to date documentation. Once the you have the app running, simply go to localhost:5280 to launch the docs site. Or just visit our [GitHub Pages](http://markitondemand.github.io/mk-ui/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markitondemand/mk-ui.git mk-ui

cd mk-ui

npm install !!!!NOTE THAT THIS REQUIRES AN OLDER VERSION OF NODE/NPM 6.10.0 WORKS!!!!

node index.js
```

### Bugs, Patches, Features, and Pull Requests

When implementing a bug fix, patch, feature, and creating a pull request, you'll want to modify the JavaScript source files that live in /src/js. For CSS/SCSS changes, you'll want to make modifications to /dist/scss. DO NOT MODIFY JAVASCRIPT or .CSS FILES LIVING IN THE DIST FOLDER. When your changes are completed and at a point where you're ready to open a Pull Request, we have a couple handy gulp methods you should take advantage of first.

For compiling SCSS to CSS:

```bash
gulp sass
```

For compiling LESS to CSS (use for testing only. SCSS output is cleaner):

```bash
gulp less
```

For concating the Core files (Mk Core or Mk DOM). 
Use when making changes to the Core or DOM and *BEFORE* minify.

```bash
# to build core
gulp build-core

#to build dom
gulp build-dom
```

For creating both minified and unminified JavaScript files in the dist folder:

```bash
gulp minify
```

If you edit any documentation pages:

```bash
gulp static-site
```
Publishing:
Log in to the npmjs.org registry. 
If you are on a Markit machine you need to log out of Artifactory and into npmjs.org first.
Make sure the version number has been bumped in the package.json file or you will not be able to create a new package.
```bash
npm login
# enter username and password at the prompt
npm publish
```
